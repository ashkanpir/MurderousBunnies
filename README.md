# MurderousBunnies
Connection? What Connection?
This was a very fun learning experience, designed by Tal Mizrachi. The idea and the complexity is suitable, well-thought, and amazing. He claims, and I do not doubt it, that there is a connection between bunnies' names and peoples' names. Revealing, or at least, providing some insight as to why the murders occurred. So far, I have not been able to find this after some 6 hours of working on it on and off. Feel free to play around and see if you could prove such a connection.
